Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution

alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add
Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different
license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution
of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add
Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different
license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution
of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
